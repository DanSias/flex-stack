# Flex Stack

**Flex Stack** is a stretch and mobility routine tracker built with modern web tooling. It allows users to build custom routines, walk through them step-by-step, and track progress over time — whether it's for daily neck stretches, full-body mobility, or structured recovery work.

> 💘 Built for movement, logged with precision.
